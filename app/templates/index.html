          <p>Secondary structures have a major impact on the protein structures and their assembly process.
          The alpha-helix and the beta-sheet, are the most described of these secondary structures, although 
          the turn (less common) was also identified. The other segments of the polypeptide are associated to coil.</p>

          <p>A less known repetitive structure, the PolyProline II (PPII) helix, was also identified 
          but firstly considered as having too low frequency to deserve a close interest.</p>

          <p>Nevertheless, PPII helix frequency was shown to be higher than initially described ; and PPII could be 
          involved in protein - protein interactions.
          As a consequence of limited number of studies on PPII helices, the assignment tools are lacking to study 
          further these secundary structures.</p>

          <p>This database and website are dedicated to assign and analyse PPII helices.

          A PPII is formed by several consecutive residues adopting (φ,ψ) backbone dihedral angles respectively 
          near -75° and 150°, and have trans isomers of their peptide bond.</p>
          <p>Note : these PolyProline II helices could also commonly occur in polypeptids with other residues 
          apart from proline.</p>
